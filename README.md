🎯What went really well and what could have gone better?

- Discussed a few project ideas and quickly came to a joint decision that we would work on a recipe sharing application
- Efficient planning on Day 1 meant we could set to work on Day 2
- Set up Trello, Discord, Git Repo, Supabase early
- Established the database connection early
- Set up basic framework for app, which meant we could then start to focus on other areas such as styling
