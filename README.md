Week 12 - Final Group Project - Spoonly

Project name: Spoonly
Vercel link: https://spoonlyfinal.vercel.app
Repo link: https://github.com/CW987/spoonly

Team members:
Cameron, Natasha, Hannah and Curtis

Project description:
The aim of the project was to create an app for keen foodies, bakers and makers to search recipes and comment on them, upload their own creations and allow other users to comment on them. Future goals include gamifying the app so that users can get 'spoon streaks' for every day of the week, month, and year, with a leaderboard showing other users challenges and awards.

Problem domain:
Users needed an app to use to share their own creations, search recipes, and add comments.

Reflection
🎯 What requirements did you achieve?
Please see user stories above

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
Please see stretch user stories above

🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

- Mainly due to time constraints, and working as a team of 3 not 4 due to sickness.

🎯What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?
Accessibility: https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessibility
Radix: https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/overview/introduction

🎯What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?

- API errors

🎯What went really well and what could have gone better?

- Discussed a few project ideas and quickly came to a joint decision that we would work on a recipe sharing application
- Efficient planning on Day 1 meant we could set to work on Day 2
- Set up Wireframe, Trello, Discord, Git Repo, Supabase early
- Established the database connection early
- Set up basic framework for app, which meant we could then start to focus on other areas such as styling

PIVOT!

- On Tuesday afternoon, we realised that the structure of our pages wasn't overly intuitive and came together as a group to refine this. Although it did mean going over some work, much of the functionality already existed and we were able to make the page much more user-friendly (e.g. removing the seperate 'Add Post' page and instead having a button on the Recipes and Creation pages).

What didn't go quite so well?

- Slow hardware
- Difficulties implementing an API
- Team sickness
- GitHub merge conflicts
